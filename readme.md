# Web Practices Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension is named "Web Practices" and is designed to streamline the rapid exploration of websites in search of good practices in accessibility, code, and SEO. It was developed by [Pablo Santalla](http://pablosantalla.com) to cater to specific needs.

## Key Features

- **Header Highlighting**: The extension highlights headers (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) on the website and adds a corresponding background "dot" for each header level. This makes it easier to identify the hierarchy of titles on the page.

2. Navigate to a website you want to analyze.
3. Activate the extension by clicking on its icon in the Chrome toolbar.
